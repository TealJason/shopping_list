This repo will be for making a shopping list tracker, I also want to playaround with using db in djano perferably psql.

The goal of the project is make a site that will do these things:
1. Allow the entry of recipes into a recipe book that can be browsed.
2. Allow for the creation of a shopping list based on a set of recipes you want to make/ go shopping for
3. allow for the entry of the contents of your pantry/fidge to suggest which meals in the recipe book you can curently cook/have the most ingrediants for
